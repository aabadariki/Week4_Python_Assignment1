#File Read & Write with Error Handling

This Python program reads the contents of a file, modifies the text (by converting it to uppercase), and saves the result into a new file.

- The user is asked to enter the name of a file to read.
- If the file exists, the program creates a new file with the modified content (e.g., modified_filename.txt).
- If the file does not exist or cannot be read, the program shows an error message instead of crashing.

This exercise was created to practice file handling and error handling in Python.
